### Prerequisites

`git clone https://github.com/JiaqiGao/cdph-react-native/`

We recommend to use yarn for better management of dependency versioning.

`brew install yarn`

`yarn install`

Otherwise you can also use npm to install packages.

`npm install`

Run the app in an iOS simulator with

`react-native run-ios`

If you get a bundle error, do
`react-native upgrade` and opt to keep your current .gitignore but replace the xproj
