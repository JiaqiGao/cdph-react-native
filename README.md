`react-native run-ios`

If you get a bundle error, do
`react-native upgrade` and opt to keep your current .gitignore but replace the xproj


## Customize

Edit the app from the src folder, adding any necessary components and pages. Disease information powering the app is pulled from `src/assets/data.json`. Please maintain the structure of the json file when adding new diseases or removing previous ones.
